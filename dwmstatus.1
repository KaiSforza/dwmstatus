.TH DWMSTATUS 1 dwmstatus\-VERSION
.SH NAME
dwmstatus \- simple status bar
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwmstatus
.RB [ \-vo ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwmstatus is a simple, small status bar originally for dwm. Unlike large,
complex shell scripts, this status bar tries to stay clean and concise, has no
configuration file, and must be recompiled to change settings, similar to dwm.
It can output to the dwm statusbar (set the xroot label) or to stdout for use
with other status bars or programs.
.P
The default setup has 5 sections (from left to right): network usage, battery
status, computer load, temperature, and time. These are separated by pipes, and
read to the specific files in the #defines at the top of the dwmstatus.c file.
.P
To edit this status bar, you must change the #defines to match where your
system information is located and recompile.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Prints version information to stdout then exits with status 0
.TP
.B \-o
Print status to stdout instead of updating the status bar
.SH USAGE
.TP
Run dwbstatus in a shell and it will put its output into the dwm status bar
area (the right side of the bar by default).
.SH CONFIG
.TP
.B config.h
This is the config file for dwmstatus. Edit this before compiling to change
where dwmstatus looks for things.
